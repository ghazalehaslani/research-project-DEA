# Provision of care: are we being "efficient"?

## Introduction

* A method for measuring the efficiency of decision-making units (DMUs), such as companies, hospitals, or departments, without using technical terms.
* Built broadly on concepts of inputs and outputs: Inputs are the resources (staff, budget, equipment), and outputs are the results (sales, services, products). 
* Primary output is an efficiency score where DEA compares similar units (like hospitals or schools) to see which ones are using their resources most efficiently – it is not about absolute performance (like the biggest hospital) but how well they use what they have.
* At its core, it is about helping describe improvement opportunities – it is one ML approach to identify best practice and improve efficiency
* It offers some support to how to allocate resources to improve a DMU's efficiency score

  + Number of Beds (Represents capacity to treat patients)
  + Number of Doctors/Physicians(Staff involved in providing care)
  + Number of Nurses (Nursing staff, essential for patient care)
  + Number of Midwives/Professionals (Specific care providers in certain types of facilities)
  + Number of Ambulances (Facility's ability to respond to emergencies)

# Output (Results Achieved):

  + Average Monthly Patient Footfall (Number of patients served per month, showing the facility’s service level)

### Basic folder structure

* src Folder: The source code folder! Please do not put files in here that contain languages using header
* test Folder: Unit tests, integration tests etc go here.
* dep Folder: This is the directory where all your dependencies should be stored.
* doc Folder: The documentation folder
* res Folder: For all static resources in your project. For example, images, staging outputs and figures.
* app_root Folder: Environment to publish an app if needed.

## Build and Test

* R version 4.4.1
* Please store any tests in the 'test' folder only
